## ***What is Neutron Star?***
***Death is also true for star. Death of less densed star called white Dwarf and The death of stars whose density is 8 time than solar mass is called Neutron star.
The rotation of these star is high. Because of high rotation they create ElectronoMagnetic fields. and emmits radiation Thats Why they called 
Pulsar.:smile:***


## ***Why need them for study?***
 ***they  used to study nuclear physics, General Relativity, and they even helped prove the existence of gravitational waves.***
 
## ***How To predict Pulsar star?***
  ***our telescopes can capture signals and show us the unique radio pulse profile of the stars. While single pulses (pulse emission from each individual rotation)
  are highly variable. Integrated profiles are consistent and stable in time.  the effect of the interstellar medium, Dispersion Measure(DM)
  or in other words, they will allow us to distinguish pulsars from other radar-microwaves generating noise across the almost emptiness
  of space.***
